<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This air fryer cod recipe couldn't get any easier! It starts with frozen cod fillets dipped in egg wash and ranch-seasoned panko. The result is piping-hot cod fillets that are both crispy and flaky!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ranch seasoning mix</li>
    <li>4 4oz frozen cod fillets</li>
    <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes. Line the air fryer basket with a perforated parchment round.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, whisk egg in a shallow dish until lemon colored and frothy. Season with a pinch of salt. Combine panko and ranch seasoning in another shallow bowl. </li>
    <li>Dip cod fillets into egg mixture, then into panko mixture to coat. Carefully place breaded cod into the prepared basket and spray with nonstick spray.</li>
    <li>Air-fry in the preheated air fryer for about 8 minutes. Carefully flip fillets, spray again with nonstick spray, and air-fry until cod flakes easily with a fork, about 7 more minutes.</li>
